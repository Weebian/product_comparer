Using openAI's Chat GPT's API, we'll pull various product specifications and price to compare with one another. 

You need your own Key for chat GPT's API (https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

Currently set to CAD, can be modified in file

The API is unable to retrieve sales, so it is best to consider based on other specifications.

The code can be further improved by:
- having Chat GPT's model access webscraped data to obtain sales if needed
- add pandas to better tabulate data
